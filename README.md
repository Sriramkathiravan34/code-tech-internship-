# Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews Using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on a dataset of customer reviews to classify text as positive or negative. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, the text data is preprocessed, vectorized using **TF-IDF**, and classified using a **Logistic Regression** model.

The goal is to analyze textual data, understand customer sentiments, and build a predictive model that can automatically identify the sentiment of new reviews.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and implement text preprocessing techniques  
- Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF  
- Build a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Interpret the results for practical insights  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset:** Customer Reviews (can be a CSV of reviews and ratings)  
- **Features:**  
  - `review_text` → Customer review text  
  - `sentiment` → Target label (Positive / Negative or 1 / 0)  
- **Size:** Varies depending on dataset, typically 1,000–10,000 reviews  

> You can replace the sample dataset with real datasets like Amazon Reviews, IMDB, or Kaggle sentiment datasets.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Import Libraries** – Load necessary Python packages  
2. **Load Dataset** – Read CSV file of reviews  
3. **Text Preprocessing** –  
   - Lowercasing  
   - Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters  
   - Removing stopwords  
   - Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization  
4. **Vectorization** – Convert text to numerical features using **TF-IDF**  
5. **Train-Test Split** – Split data into training and testing sets  
6. **Model Training** – Train **Logistic Regression** classifier  
7. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
8. **Sample Predictions** – Test model on new reviews  

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:  
- **Accuracy Score** – Overall correctness  
- **Confusion Matrix** – True vs predicted classifications  
- **Classification Report** – Precision, Recall, F1-score  

These metrics help in assessing the predictive performance of the model.
