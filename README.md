## TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER PREDICTION USING DECISION TABLE CLASSIFICATION

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
his project demonstrates the implementation and visualization of a Decision Tree model using Python and Scikit-learn. The model is trained to classify data using the Iris dataset and provides an interpretable machine learning solution.

The project focuses on building, training, evaluating, and visualizing a Decision Tree classifier for prediction and analysis.
